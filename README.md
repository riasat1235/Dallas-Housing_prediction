# Dallas-Housing_prediction
This project is a **end to end housing price prediction projects with supervised Machine Learning- linear regression**. In this project, the housing prices of Dallas, available on September, are collected using private API key from Zillow. Next, additional features are added by collecting and scrapping data based on the addresses and zip codes from different websites using private API and beautiful soup.  These raw data are prepared for the machine learning model using feature engineering. Finally, the predicted model is deployed in AWS creating a FLASK web application.
